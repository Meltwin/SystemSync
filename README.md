<h1 align="center">System Sync</h1>

This repository contains the sources for an application that can sync an installation between several 
devices through a list of tasks (as for a Docker). It will look into a distant endpoint file for the latest version of 
a description and refresh the device accordingly.

This application will be essentially written in Python.
